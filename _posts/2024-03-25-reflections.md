A close friend of mine is an INTJ. He mentioned having an N score of over 90%, and I've always enjoyed our conversations since we met. I appreciate forming connections with individuals who are intuitive. Recently, I've been working on training embedding models, and I'm particularly interested in replicating intuitivity with language models. Their unique perspectives often contribute unexpectedly helpful solutions to problems.

I'm not fond of the competitive nature often described as involution, where those with ample resources don't contribute meaningfully -- I mean, productivity improvement. 

There are those who take pride in their work in discrete optimization, such as designing convolutional kernels manually or empirical rules, considering themselves as refined thinkers. However, it might be beneficial for them to focus more on meta learning.
