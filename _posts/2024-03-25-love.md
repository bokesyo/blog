What is love? I found myself hard to love others. I feel really depressed when I want to love. That's strange. But if you view love somewhat `sex`, that's another issue. I mean love is, to truthfully, emotional support someone, and being supported by someone, share something common and spent sometime together. But C pretend that she know you. In fact, she don't. After few months, you will find that C just have pretended to do so - you know - very depressing. 

<!-- I always feel guilty about doing really bad things to C. It's my fault. I feel sorry and hate myself. For her, I only care about `enjoy myself of being loved` rather than truly make more spiritual support. I doubt that I never loved C. 

I am commited to some metaphysics research topics and feel hard to love. Yes, hard to love. I want to escape. -->
