Long time no see. Sometimes I feel that I've made some connections to the world again... I am alive again... 

But the difficulties still present. I dream about good things, but the reality is not good. Work has to be done, and life has to go on. I tried to analyze myself and others. That makes me feel really good. 

To write some texts without any interruptions, is really good.

I missed the year of 2020. It was golden. Now I finally got some feelings of 2020. 

Thank you, my friend.
