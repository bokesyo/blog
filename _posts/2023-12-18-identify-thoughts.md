I learned how to identify those thoughts that we have got used to, from a friend, during 1 year's time. He is genius in analytic philosophy. To think about conciousness and symbolization of people in society/institutions.

The naming of a person is the beginning of symbolization. Under the context of symbolization, life is precious to some extent. Without such symbolization, it is possible to view every individual similar to animals. In such case, to die is not scaring anymore.
